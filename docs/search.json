The world map shows the GDP in 2023 as a headmap based on a data set from the World Bank. The challenge was not only of a technical nature. Due to the fact that the USA and China are extremely strong compared to all other countries, it is not easy to show this as a heat map. Without a few tricks in the color scaling, the rest would not differ in color due to this extreme inequality.\nThe “change map/graph” button can be used to switch to a plot of the trend data for the six strongest economies. The trend also gives an impression of the inequality which the color scaling problem causes."

The Avarage Marginal Effects (AME) are shown in percent. An example: An AME of 30% means that the probability of voting for the CDU/CSU increases by 30% on average if the variable increases by one unit (please note that the dummy variables can only take the values 0 or 1). Below the plots, the variables are explained.\nThe result is that economic voting only had an impact in the crisis years 2009 and 2021. However, the situation in 2021 is not so valid, because the confidence interval is close to the null hypothesis. null hypothesis in this case means the absence of an effect; Confidence intervals provide information about the range within which the true effect at the population level lies, given the data and the chosen level of confidence (here 95%). Nevertheless, the models make very good predictions, as they contain a very strong predictor in the form of party identif\nThe data comes from the following data sets:\nGLES, 2019a: Post-election Cross Section (GLES 2009).
