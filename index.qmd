Hi, I'm Christopher!

I'm passionate about analising data with R with a focus on social science and economics. Right now, I'm building a portfolio here and will be gradually expanding it over time.

Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or learning more about my skills.
